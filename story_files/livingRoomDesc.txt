You are in a cramped room with windows looking south and west.  There are plants in the window and a table in the far corner of the room with a bowl full of something that looks like fruit on it. There is also a bicycle leaning against one wall.  There is a door behind that leads outside.  It has boards nailed over it.  You see an dark hallway to your north and a doorway to your east.
