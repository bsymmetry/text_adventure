plant: a plant in a clay pot sits on the windowsill.  The plant is clearly in the succulent family with spikey protuburences for leaves.  It seems vaguely medicinal.
bicycle: a touring bike leans up against the wall to the right side of the front door.  The chain is rusty and fallen off and the seat is missing.
fruit: a bowl of rotten fruit stands in the middle of the table in the far corner of the room.
